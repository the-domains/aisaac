THE END OF MARKETS, OR CAN AI BRING ABOUT THE SOVIET DREAM?

In 1975, the Nobel Prize was (co-) awarded to a Soviet economist.

In his[Nobel Prize lecture][0], Leonid Vitaliyevich Kantorovich hinted that algorithms would help deliver the economic ambition of the USSR, ie achieve an "_all-level economic control_":

> _I am looking optimistically on the prospects of wide spread of mathematical methods, especially those of optimization, in economic science and in all-level economic control. It can give us a significant improvement of planning activity, better use of resources, increment of national income and living standards._
> 
> The difficulties of modelling and data creation can be overcome like similar difficulties were overcome in the natural and technical sciences. My hope is based on the more and more intensive steam of research for new methods and algorithms in this field, on the fact of appearance of new theoretical approaches and problem statements, on a series of concrete studies of general and special problems concerning separate economic branches, on the fact that a whole army of talented young researchers work now in this field. A significant progress is now being made in the development of computer hard- and software and their mastering.

Now that AI is here, are we en route to wide scale sovietization of the economy?

In a [thought provoking paper][1] (and a [forthcoming book ][2]due in September I am told), Maurice Stucke and Ariel Ezrachi discuss a close issue, ie "_the end of competition as we know it_".

They believe that the outsourcing of pricing decisions to artificially intelligent machines will lead to new forms of restrictions of competition.

Tacit collusion, perfect price discrimination (aka as dynamic pricing), and freemiums (the hidden price of free goods) are cases in point.

Maurice and Ariel's gloomy predictions raise one central question: that of the remedy.

Our current systems of competition laws are very poorly equipped to address those questions. On tacit collusion, see [this paper][3].

And this ressuscitates the specter of Kantorovich.

If Government can optimize the entire economy with algorithms, why shall we in the first place outsource the allocation of resources to markets where prices and competition are distorded by the operation of intelligent machines?

Big question for a big problem...
