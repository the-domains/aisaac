# Wardens in Belgian prisons have been on strike for a week.

Yesterday, the Government [sent the army in to provide minimum service to inmates][0](food, phone calls, visits, walk, etc.) .

This infuriated the wardens who today intensified the strike.

The wardens outcries are certainly understandable.

The poor working conditions in Western prisons have been abundantly documented.

And austerity measures in all areas of the public sector have certainly compounded the problem.

With this, the Belgian Government is now trapped in a social conflict.

And the Belgian press -- which leans in support of the opposition -- has lambasted the Government, whose channeling of military resources towards prisons is seen as an attempt to undermine the fundamental right to strike.

As usual, it is possible to anticipate that the issue will be resolved with the pouring of some emergency subsidies on prisons.

Now, why talk about this on AISAAC?

Because anyone with a slight interest in AI and robotics is inclined to find those disputes short sighted.

In some years, wardening is the type of routine job that should be substituted to robots.

South Korea made the news in 2012, for being the [first country to experiment robot-guards][1].

With this background, the people in office should warn wardens that their jobs are not sustainable in the long term. As economist Jean Tirole says, Governments should adopt measures to protect workers, not jobs.

And a corrolary is that the wardens' demands should focus on assistance to retraining in non routine activities.

Last, from a legal standpoint, the Belgian strikes give rise to an interesting observation: today's militarization and tomorrow's automation of basic routine jobs progressively render the fundamental right to strike moot.

A progress for society???

This is for the reader to decide.
